Technical Test
-------------------------------------

This Java project uses BDD test automation alongside Apache Fluent HC in order to interrogate an API. 

The API carries a series of JSON data that includes details of Songs as and playlists.

Running these tests 
-------------------------------------

When you clone this project you will find two runners under the cucumberRunners folder. 
These will be called: 

 - VideoPlayListAPITestRunnerTest
 - VideoSongAPITestRunnerTest 

In order to be able to run each one you just need to add a JUnit runner to your project pointing to the correct runner.
